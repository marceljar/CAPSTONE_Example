## Project Description

Teaching CAPSTONE courses at Seneca presents several challenges because Blackboard lacks key tools and features. For instance, Blackboard does not provide functionality for students to select their preferred meeting times, which makes scheduling across different groups both complicated and error-prone. In addition, there is no centralized location where students can easily review the course evaluation schema, nor is there a calendar that combines weekly course content with assignment due dates.

To address these challenges, this project involves developing a website specifically designed for faculty teaching CAPSTONE courses. The website includes three core tools: a timeslot selection tool, a course information page, and a calendar page. The timeslot tool allows faculty to create meeting slots that students can claim, automatically notifying all group members of their chosen time. The course information page introduces the course, outlines the evaluation schema, and highlights academic honesty requirements. The calendar page displays the schedule of classes, linked directly to assignment submission deadlines, ensuring students have a clear overview of expectations.

The website is hosted on a Digital Ocean server running Ubuntu 24.04, with Nginx acting as a proxy. It uses Node.js and Express for the back-end and vanilla JavaScript for the front-end. Bootstrap 5.0 provides a responsive design framework, ensuring accessibility across devices. Development was carried out using Visual Studio Code, and Postman was employed to test HTTP requests, allowing for efficient separation of back-end and front-end development tasks.
